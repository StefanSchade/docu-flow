# explanation: As we run in a container that mounts the project repo read-only,
# we cannot rely on these scripts being executable. Therefore, they are copied
# over to ~/scripts where we can take ownership and run them. After a change,
# these copies have to be refreshedâ€”this is the responsibility of this script.
#
# The challenge is that this script (update_scripts.sh) itself is subject to
# the update, and it might also be called by other scripts. To avoid a script
# copying itself while running, we copy to a temporary directory with a random
# number and schedule the replacement once the script is not running anymore.
