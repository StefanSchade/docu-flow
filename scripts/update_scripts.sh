# explanation: As we run in a container that mounts the project repo read-only,
# we cannot rely on these scripts being executable. Therefore, they are copied
# over to ~/scripts where we can take ownership and run them. After a change,
# these copies have to be refreshedâ€”this is the responsibility of this script.
#
# The challenge is that this script (update_scripts.sh) itself is subject to
# the update, and it might also be called by other scripts. To avoid a script
# copying itself while running, we copy to a temporary directory with a random
# number and schedule the replacement once the script is not running anymore.

# Define source and target directories
SOURCE_DIR="/workspace/scripts/"
TARGET_DIR="${HOME}/scripts"

# Generate a random number for the temporary directory
RANDOM_NUMBER=$(shuf -i 10000-99999 -n 1)
TEMP_DIR="${HOME}/.tmp_scripts_$RANDOM_NUMBER"

# Check if the temporary directory already exists
if [ -d "$TEMP_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Error: Temporary directory $TEMP_DIR already exists. Aborting."
